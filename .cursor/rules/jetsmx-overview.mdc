# JetsMX Agent – Project Overview

You are helping build the **JetsMX Agent**, a multi-agent system for JetstreamMX LLC (JetsMX), an AOG aircraft maintenance company operating in the U.S. Northeast.

## Business context

- JetsMX is a **mobile, owner-operator AOG and maintenance provider** focused on business aviation.
- We support on-call diagnostics, troubleshooting, and line maintenance for business jets and turboprops.
- Safety, reliability, and documentation quality are non-negotiable.

## High-level goals for this repo

- Implement a **modular, workflow-driven agent system** using **Google ADK** and **Vertex AI Agent Builder** (see @Google ADK and @VertexAI Builder).
- Expose tools over:
  - Google Workspace (Gmail, Calendar, Chat, Drive, Meet, Docs, Sheets, Tasks, People, Apps Script).
  - Airtable (our primary structured DB for applicants, contractors, and some ops data).
  - Cloud Pub/Sub for event routing.
  - Later: QuickBooks and other 3rd-party APIs.

- Support two primary usage patterns:
  1. **Automated workflows** (event-driven, no direct chat).
  2. **Conversational layer** available in **Google Chat** that can:
     - Answer questions about schedules, emails, files, and Airtable data.
     - Execute routine tasks when explicitly asked (e.g., “draft an email to this applicant”, “schedule a probe call”).

## Initial agents/workflows

1. **Company Knowledge Base Agent**
   - Conversational agent with access to company docs (Drive), Airtable records, and calendar/email metadata.
   - Answers questions and can run read-heavy queries; write operations must be explicitly asked for.

2. **Applicant Analysis Agent**
   - Listens for new resume PDFs added to a specific Drive folder.
   - Uses company job descriptions and ideal candidate profiles to:
     - Extract structured facts (contact, A&P, aircraft/engine experience, on-call suitability).
     - Generate a standardized report / cover page.
     - Populate applicant and pipeline tables in Airtable via @Airtable API.

3. **HR Agent (Hiring Workflow Coordinator)**
   - Manages the pipeline once an applicant exists:
     - Drafts and sends emails via @Gmail API.
     - Parses applicant replies, extracts availability/contact details.
     - Schedules phone probes and interviews via @Google Calendar API and @Google Meet REST API.
     - Sends coordination messages/cards in @Google Chat API.
     - Updates Airtable pipeline records consistently.

## Design principles

- **Modular tools, small graphs**: Prefer multiple focused agents/graphs over one mega-agent.
- **Event-driven**: Use @Cloud Pub/Sub API and webhooks (e.g., Airtable, Gmail watch) to trigger workflows.
- **Human-in-the-loop**: All outbound candidate communication and hiring decisions must have a clear human approval step.
- **Auditability**: Every automated action that changes external state (emails, calendar events, Airtable records) should be easy to trace back to logs and workflow state.

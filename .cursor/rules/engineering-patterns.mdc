# JetsMX Agent – Engineering Patterns

## Languages, frameworks, and architecture

- Use **Python** with **Google ADK** and **Python ADK API** (@Google ADK, @Python ADK API).
- Agents and tools should be **modular**:
  - Keep tools (API wrappers) in dedicated modules.
  - Keep high-level workflows as separate “graphs” or agents.
- Deploy components as:
  - Vertex AI agents where appropriate (@VertexAI Builder).
  - Cloud Run services for webhook receivers and Pub/Sub subscription handlers.

## Coding guidelines

- Prefer small, pure functions with explicit inputs/outputs.
- Provide basic error handling and retries for external API calls (Gmail, Airtable, Drive, Pub/Sub).
- Use consistent logging so we can trace any action that:
  - Sends an email.
  - Modifies Airtable or other databases.
  - Creates/updates calendar events.

## Structure suggestions (for planning agent)

A typical layout for generated code might look like:

- `agents/`
  - `company_kb/`
  - `applicant_analysis/`
  - `hr_pipeline/`
- `tools/`
  - `airtable_tools.py`
  - `gmail_tools.py`
  - `calendar_tools.py`
  - `drive_tools.py`
  - `chat_tools.py`
  - `pubsub_tools.py`
- `infra/`
  - `pubsub_handlers/`
  - `webhooks/`
  - `deploy/` (Dockerfiles, YAMLs, etc.)

Planning tasks should propose or align with a structure like this and avoid creating deeply nested, over-complex hierarchies.

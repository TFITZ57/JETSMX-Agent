# JetsMX Agent – Guardrails and Permissions

This system will have broad access to company data. Respect the following rules:

## General principles

- **Read is easy, write is careful.**
- For any action that affects an external person (candidate, customer), prefer a **draft + human approval** pattern.
- Never store highly sensitive data (e.g., full SSNs, full card numbers) outside designated secure systems.

## High-risk actions (require explicit design and often human approval)

- Sending emails via @Gmail API.
- Creating or modifying Calendar events via @Google Calendar API.
- Editing or deleting files in Drive via @Google Drive API.
- Modifying Airtable records that represent final decisions (hire/no-hire, pay rates).
- Any QuickBooks or billing action (when introduced).

These actions should either:
- Be triggered explicitly by a human command (e.g., typed instruction in Chat), or
- Pass through an explicit approval step (e.g., Chat card with Approve button, or status toggle in Airtable).

## Data and PII

- Applicant and contractor PII (phone, email, A&P, last-4 identifiers) are stored primarily in Airtable.
- Summaries in Chat or logs should **not** include more than is necessary (e.g., avoid printing full A&P numbers unless explicitly requested).
- Do not invent or hallucinate credentials.

## Logging

- For each write action, log:
  - Who initiated it (agent + human, if applicable).
  - Which external resource was modified (Airtable record ID, Gmail message ID, Drive file ID, etc.).
  - The before/after state, if cheap enough, or at least the fields changed.

These rules should inform how the planning agent designs function signatures and workflows.
